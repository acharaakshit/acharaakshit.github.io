I am doctoral candidate associated with the <a href="https://www.kclmmag.org/home">MMAG</a> at the King's College London. My interests broadly lie in all aspects of deep learning. I am currently working on the analysis of fairness of deep learning methods for medical imaging.

Previously, I was a Research Engineer working with the AI Research team
at GE Healthcare, Bangalore, India where I primarily working on 
developing NLP techniques for patient reports to aid in
timeline based patient journeys.

I also spent a summer developing <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rminizinc/index.html">
rminizinc</a>: an interface
to MiniZinc in R, advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.uwyo.edu/~larsko/">
Lars Kotthoff</a> , Mr. <a href="https://hwborchers.lima-city.de/"> Hans W. Borchers</a> and
Prof. <a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/guido-tack">Guido Tack</a>.

Prior to GE, I pursued MSc. Mathematics from BITS Pilani. I did my Master's thesis
at TU Munich, advised by Prof. <a href="https://biomedical-big-data.de/authors/markus_list/">
Markus List</a>, where I worked on developing machine 
learning frameworks for benchmarking sequence based miRNA tools.

In my spare time, I play sports (primarily Cricket and Football), listen to music and catch-up with my friends.
