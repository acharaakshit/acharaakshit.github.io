I am a doctoral candidate associated with the <a href="https://www.kclmmag.org/home">Motion Modelling & Analysis Group</a> at King's College London. My interests broadly lie in all aspects of deep learning. I am currently working on fairness in deep learning with special focus on medical imaging. Specifically, I am interested in <b>invariant representation learning for fairness</b>, <b>bias attribution using interpretability methods</b> and <b>fairness metrics</b>.

Previously, I was a Research Engineer at GE Healthcare, Bangalore, India where I primarily worked on NLP approaches for timeline based report summarisation.

In my spare time, I play sports (primarily Cricket and Football), listen to music and catch-up with my friends.

<b style='color:red;'>I am always looking for research collaboration on fundamental problems in deep learning. Feel free to email me!</b>
