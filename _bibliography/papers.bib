  abstract={Supervised deep learning models require significant amount of labeled data to achieve
an acceptable performance on a specific task. However, when tested on unseen data,
the models may not perform well. Therefore, the models need to be trained with
additional and varying labeled data to improve the generalization. In this work, our goal
is to understand the models, their performance and generalization. We establish
image-image, dataset-dataset, and image-dataset distances to gain insights into the
model's behavior. Our proposed distance metric when combined with model
performance can help in selecting an appropriate model/architecture from a pool of
candidate architectures. We have shown that the generalization of these models can
be improved by only adding a small number of unseen images (say 1, 3 or 7) into the
training set. Our proposed approach reduces training and annotation costs while
providing an estimate of model performance on unseen data in dynamic environments.}

abstract = {Supervised and semi-supervised semantic segmentation algorithms require significant amount of annotated data to achieve a good performance. In many situations, the data is either not available or the annotation is expensive. The objective of this work is to show that by incorporating domain knowledge along with deep learning architectures, we can achieve similar performance with less data. We have used publicly available crack segmentation datasets and shown that selecting the input images using knowledge can significantly boost the performance of deep-learning based architectures. Our proposed approaches have many fold advantages such as low annotation and training cost, and less energy consumption. We have measured the performance of our algorithm quantitatively in terms of mean intersection over union (mIoU) and F-score. Our representative model, developed with 23% of the overall data; surpasses the baseline model (>1.5% F-score gain) on the test data while matching the benchmark performance and, with a suitable augmentation strategy, outperforms the baseline model (11.5% average F-score gain) and the benchmark (>8.75% average F-score gain) over the selected blind datasets.}

  abstract={Automatically detecting or segmenting cracks in images can help in reducing the cost of maintenance or operations. Detecting, measuring and quantifying cracks for distress analysis in challenging background scenarios is a difficult task as there is no clear boundary that separates cracks from the background. Some of the other perceptually noted challenges with the images are variations in color, intensity, depth, blur, motion-blur, orientation, region of interest (ROI) for the defect, scale, illumination, backgrounds, etc. These variations occur across (crack inter-class) and within images (crack intra-class variabilities). In this work, we have proposed a stochastic width (SW) approach to reduce the effect of these variations. Our proposed approach improves detectability and significantly reduces false positives and negatives. We have measured the performance of our algorithm objectively in terms of mean intersection over union (mIoU) and subjectively in terms of perceptual quality.}
