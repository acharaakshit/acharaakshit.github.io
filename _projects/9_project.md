<h3><b>Background</b></h3>
<p>
Model performance on unseen data determines the strength of the solution used for automation. An understanding of model behaviour and the relationship
of data with generalizaion and performance can help in improving the autonomous solutions and designing the continual learning framework for the 
model. We explore the relation between model, data, performance and generalization by considering various tasks like semantic segmentation, scene
understanding and person re-identification. One of the proposed techniques is to compute a distance metric between two datasets and also between an image
and dataset. If the training data is taken into consideration, the distances of unseen images and datasets can be computed from the training data (referred
as primary dataset in the published article). In the further sections, we show the computation of these distances which can be used for experiments focused
on the relationship with model and its generalization (see article for more details).
