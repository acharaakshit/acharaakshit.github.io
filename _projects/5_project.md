We developed an application to montior real-time crowd at public and private organizations like
hospitals, banks, ATMs, pharmacies and stores. The count of crowd was provided for locations
within 50km radius. The application required QR codes scanned at the locations that would update
the counter on our portal. Modules were added to provided the order pickup functionality as well. This allowed the users to plan their travel accordingly and avoid contact with other people
to prevent possible COVID infection. The
source code can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/acharaakshit/COV-AID">here</a>.
