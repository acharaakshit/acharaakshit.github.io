Medical Applications are one of the biggest consumers of textual data containing patient reports, metadata, medical research articles,
clinical trials, etc. However, unlike the structured nature of text in various real-world domains, medical text is at times unstructured
and consists of multiple aliases of a common concept, abbreviations and other ambiguous terms that need to be contextualized.

<h3><b>Summarization</b></h3>

A patient's journey comprises of multiple events from diagnosis to treatment and each event has a report associated with it. The clinician
has to go through these reports to understand the state of the patient for treatment decisions. This process is time consuming and 
requires structured information to ensure readability. Therefore, comprehensive summarization of medical events can have a significant
impact on healthcare systems allowing more time for treatment. The temporal nature of summarization can also aid in developing applications
for the future and prevent adverse events.

<h3><b>Standarization</b></h3>
The ambiguity in medical text can cause delays in multiple operations and require manual intevention from medical staff to move the processes.
For instance, the medical regimen assigned to a patient needs to be ordered by the hospital/clinic pharmacy from dedicated inventories. The
ambiguity in medication names needs to be resolved before placing the order as incorrect orders can cause issues especially in case of
emergency medications. Text standardization utilizing multiple NLP techniques like Named Entity Recognition and Entity Linking can help 
alleviate these issues.
